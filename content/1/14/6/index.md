## 14.6. Practical Exercises

In this section, we delve into practical exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of debugging and optimization in functional programming. These exercises will challenge you to identify and fix common bugs in functional code and apply optimization techniques such as lazy evaluation and memoization to enhance performance. By working through these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience in improving the efficiency and reliability of functional programs.

### Debugging Real-World Functional Code

Debugging functional code can be a unique challenge due to the immutability and pure function principles that often obscure traditional debugging techniques. However, these same principles can also simplify the debugging process by reducing side effects and making code behavior more predictable. Let's explore a practical exercise to hone your debugging skills.

#### Exercise 1: Debugging a Haskell Function

Consider the following Haskell function intended to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The function contains a common bug that leads to inefficiency and potential stack overflow for large inputs. Your task is to identify the bug and optimize the function using memoization.

```haskell
-- Task: Debug and optimize a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
fibonacci :: Int -> Int
fibonacci 0 = 0
fibonacci 1 = 1
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)

-- Optimized with Memoization
fibonacciMemo :: Int -> Int
fibonacciMemo n = fibs ! n
  where
    fibs = listArray (0, n) (map fib [0..n])
    fib 0 = 0
    fib 1 = 1
    fib k = fibs ! (k - 1) + fibs ! (k - 2)
```

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify the Bug:** The original `fibonacci` function uses a naive recursive approach, leading to exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Optimize with Memoization:** Implement memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers, reducing the time complexity to linear.

**Solution Explanation:**

The optimized version uses an array to store Fibonacci numbers as they are computed. This approach ensures that each number is calculated only once, significantly improving performance.

### Implementing Optimizations in Functional Programs

Optimization in functional programming often involves techniques like lazy evaluation and memoization. These techniques can drastically improve the performance of recursive functions and data processing tasks.

#### Exercise 2: Optimizing a JavaScript Function

The following JavaScript function calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive approach. Your task is to optimize this function using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

```javascript
// Task: Optimize a recursive factorial function with memoization
const factorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
};

// Optimized with Memoization
const memoize = (f) => {
  const cache = {};
  return (...args) => {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) return cache[key];
    const result = f(...args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
};

const optimizedFactorial = memoize((n) => {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * optimizedFactorial(n - 1);
});

console.log(optimizedFactorial(5)); // 120
```

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Inefficiency:** The original `factorial` function recalculates results for the same inputs multiple times.
2. **Implement Memoization:** Use a caching mechanism to store results of previous calculations, thereby reducing redundant computations.

**Solution Explanation:**

The `memoize` function creates a cache object to store results of function calls. When the `optimizedFactorial` function is called, it first checks if the result is already in the cache, returning it if available, or computing and storing it if not.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the debugging and optimization processes, let's use Mermaid.js to illustrate the flow of these exercises.

#### Debugging and Optimization Process

This flowchart represents the steps involved in debugging and optimizing a functional program. By following this process, you can systematically improve the efficiency of your code.
