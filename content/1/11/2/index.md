## 11.2. Setting Up the Development Environment

Setting up a development environment is a crucial step in your journey to mastering functional programming. This section provides detailed instructions for installing and configuring the necessary tools for Haskell, Scala, F#, and JavaScript. We will also explore how to enhance your coding experience with popular IDEs and editors.

### Installation Guides for Selected Languages

#### Haskell: GHC and Stack

Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language known for its expressive type system and lazy evaluation. To get started with Haskell, you'll need to install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and Stack, a build tool for Haskell projects.

1. **Install GHC and Stack:**
   - Visit the [Haskell Official Website](https://www.haskell.org/) and download the Haskell Platform, which includes GHC and Stack.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal and run the following commands to verify the installation:
     ```bash
     ghc --version
     stack --version
     ```

3. **Create a New Haskell Project:**
   - Use Stack to create a new project:
     ```bash
     stack new my-haskell-project
     cd my-haskell-project
     stack setup
     stack build
     ```

4. **Haskell Stack Configuration Example:**
   - Here is a basic `stack.yaml` configuration:
     ```yaml
     resolver: lts-16.27
     
     packages:
       - .
     
     extra-deps: []
     
     flags: {}
     
     build: {}
     
     haddock: {}
     
     coverage: {}
     
     tests: {}
     
     benchmarks: {}
     ```

#### Scala: sbt

Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. The primary build tool for Scala is sbt (Simple Build Tool).

1. **Install sbt:**
   - Visit the [sbt website](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     sbt sbtVersion
     ```

3. **Create a New Scala Project:**
   - Use sbt to create a new project:
     ```bash
     sbt new scala/scala-seed.g8
     cd <project-name>
     sbt compile
     ```

4. **Scala sbt Configuration Example:**
   - Here is a basic `build.sbt` configuration:
     ```scala
     name := "ScalaProject"
     
     version := "0.1"
     
     scalaVersion := "2.13.6"
     
     libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % "2.6.1"
     ```

#### F#

F# is a functional-first language that runs on the .NET platform. It is known for its succinct syntax and powerful type inference.

1. **Install .NET SDK:**
   - Visit the [Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and download the .NET SDK.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     dotnet --version
     ```

3. **Create a New F# Project:**
   - Use the .NET CLI to create a new F# console application:
     ```bash
     dotnet new console -lang "F#" -o MyFSharpApp
     cd MyFSharpApp
     dotnet run
     ```

#### JavaScript: Node.js with npm and FP Libraries

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports functional programming paradigms, especially when combined with libraries like Ramda or lodash/fp.

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version, which includes npm.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

3. **Set Up a New JavaScript Project:**
   - Initialize a new project and install functional programming libraries:
     ```bash
     mkdir my-js-project
     cd my-js-project
     npm init -y
     npm install ramda lodash
     ```

### Configuring IDEs and Editors for Functional Development

Choosing the right IDE or editor can significantly enhance your productivity and coding experience. Here, we'll discuss setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and IntelliJ IDEA for functional programming.

#### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

VSCode is a lightweight, open-source editor with a rich ecosystem of extensions.

1. **Install VSCode:**
   - Download and install VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Extensions:**
   - Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Search for and install the following extensions:
     - **Haskell:** Haskell Syntax Highlighting
     - **Scala:** Metals (Scala language server)
     - **F#:** Ionide-fsharp
     - **JavaScript:** Prettier - Code formatter, ESLint

3. **Configure Settings:**
   - Customize settings for each language by navigating to `File > Preferences > Settings`.

#### IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful IDE with excellent support for Scala and other JVM languages.

1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

2. **Install Plugins:**
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
   - Search for and install the following plugins:
     - **Scala:** Scala Plugin
     - **Haskell:** IntelliJ-Haskell
     - **F#:** ReSharper (for F# support)

3. **Configure Project Settings:**
   - Set up project-specific settings by navigating to `File > Project Structure`.
