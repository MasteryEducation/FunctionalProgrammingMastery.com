## 11.6. Practical Exercises

In this section, we will delve into practical exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of functional programming languages. These exercises will help you apply the concepts you've learned and explore language-specific features through hands-on coding tasks. By engaging with these exercises, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the power and elegance of functional programming.

### Writing Basic Programs to Solidify Understanding

To begin, let's focus on writing simple programs that utilize the core principles and syntax of functional programming languages. These exercises are designed to help you become comfortable with the fundamental concepts and idiomatic usage of each language.

#### Exercise 1: Haskell - Pattern Matching

**Task:** Create a function using pattern matching to describe a number.

```haskell
-- Define a function that uses pattern matching to describe a number
describeNumber :: Int -> String
describeNumber 0 = "Zero"
describeNumber 1 = "One"
describeNumber _ = "Other number"

-- Test the function with different inputs
main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (describeNumber 0)  -- Output: "Zero"
  print (describeNumber 1)  -- Output: "One"
  print (describeNumber 42) -- Output: "Other number"
```

**Explanation:** This exercise introduces you to Haskell's pattern matching, a powerful feature that allows you to define function behavior based on specific input patterns. By matching against different integer values, you can provide concise and readable definitions for each case.

#### Exercise 2: JavaScript - Function Composition with Ramda

**Task:** Use Ramda to create a composed function that filters even numbers and doubles them.

```javascript
// Import the Ramda library
const R = require('ramda');

// Define a function to filter even numbers
const filterEven = R.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);

// Define a function to double numbers
const double = R.map(x => x * 2);

// Compose the functions to process an array
const process = R.compose(double, filterEven);

// Test the composed function
console.log(process([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: [4, 8]
```

**Explanation:** This exercise demonstrates function composition using the Ramda library in JavaScript. By composing `filterEven` and `double`, you create a new function `process` that first filters even numbers and then doubles them. This approach showcases the elegance of functional programming in handling data transformations.

### Experimenting with Language-Specific Functional Features

Next, let's explore advanced features unique to specific functional programming languages. These exercises will challenge you to apply your knowledge and experiment with powerful language constructs.

#### Exercise 3: Scala - Higher-Kinded Types

**Task:** Implement a simple example using higher-kinded types in Scala.

```scala
// Define a trait with a higher-kinded type
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
}

// Implement Functor for List
object ListFunctor extends Functor[List] {
  def map[A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => B): List[B] = fa.map(f)
}

// Test the Functor implementation
object FunctorTest extends App {
  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3)
  val doubled = ListFunctor.map(numbers)(_ * 2)
  println(doubled) // Output: List(2, 4, 6)
}
```

**Explanation:** Higher-kinded types allow you to abstract over type constructors in Scala. This exercise guides you through implementing a `Functor` type class for `List`, demonstrating how to use higher-kinded types to create reusable abstractions.

#### Exercise 4: Haskell - Lazy Evaluation

**Task:** Create a lazy list of Fibonacci numbers in Haskell.

```haskell
-- Define an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers using lazy evaluation
fibonacci :: [Integer]
fibonacci = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibonacci (tail fibonacci)

-- Take the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
main :: IO ()
main = print (take 10 fibonacci) -- Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

**Explanation:** Haskell's lazy evaluation allows you to define infinite data structures like the Fibonacci sequence. This exercise demonstrates how to create a lazy list of Fibonacci numbers, showcasing Haskell's ability to handle potentially infinite computations efficiently.

### Visual Aids

To enhance your understanding of these exercises, let's use Mermaid.js to illustrate the program structures and feature implementations.

#### Haskell Pattern Matching Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Number] --> B{Pattern Match};
    B -->|0| C[Output: "Zero"];
    B -->|1| D[Output: "One"];
    B -->|Other| E[Output: "Other number"];
```

**Explanation:** This diagram visualizes the decision-making process in the `describeNumber` function, highlighting how pattern matching directs the flow based on input values.

#### JavaScript Function Composition Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Array] --> B[Filter Even Numbers];
    B --> C[Double Numbers];
    C --> D[Output Array];
```

**Explanation:** This diagram illustrates the flow of data through the composed function `process`, showing how each step transforms the input array.
