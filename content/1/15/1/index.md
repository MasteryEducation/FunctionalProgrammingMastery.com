## 15.1. Building a Simple Calculator

In this section, we will explore how to build a simple calculator using functional programming principles. This project will help solidify your understanding of pure functions, immutability, and function composition. By the end of this section, you will have a functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and handles errors gracefully.

### Designing the Calculator with Functional Principles

Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and function composition. These principles ensure that our code is predictable, easy to test, and maintainable. Let's break down how we can apply these principles to design our calculator.

#### Pure Functions

A pure function is a function where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. In the context of our calculator, each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) should be implemented as a pure function. This means that given the same inputs, the function will always return the same output.

#### Immutability

Immutability means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, you create new data structures. This principle helps prevent unintended side effects and makes reasoning about code easier. In our calculator, we will ensure that any state or data used is immutable.

#### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining simple functions to build more complex ones. This allows us to create modular and reusable code. In our calculator, we will compose functions to handle different operations and manage the flow of data.

### Implementing Basic Arithmetic Operations

Let's implement the basic arithmetic operations using pure functions in three different functional programming languages: Haskell, JavaScript, and Scala.

#### Haskell Implementation

In Haskell, we define a data type `Operation` to represent the different arithmetic operations. The `calculate` function takes an `Operation` and two integers, returning a `Maybe Int` to handle division by zero gracefully.

```haskell
data Operation = Add | Subtract | Multiply | Divide

calculate :: Operation -> Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
calculate Add x y = Just (x + y)
calculate Subtract x y = Just (x - y)
calculate Multiply x y = Just (x * y)
calculate Divide x y = if y == 0 then Nothing else Just (x `div` y)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (calculate Add 5 3)       -- Just 8
  print (calculate Divide 10 0)   -- Nothing
```

#### JavaScript Implementation

In JavaScript, we use Ramda, a functional programming library, to implement our calculator. We define pure functions for each operation and use a `Maybe` type to handle division by zero.

```javascript
const R = require('ramda');

const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const subtract = (x, y) => x - y;
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
const divide = (x, y) => y === 0 ? Maybe.Nothing() : Maybe.Just(x / y);

const calculate = (operation, x, y) => {
  switch(operation) {
    case 'Add': return Maybe.Just(add(x, y));
    case 'Subtract': return Maybe.Just(subtract(x, y));
    case 'Multiply': return Maybe.Just(multiply(x, y));
    case 'Divide': return divide(x, y);
    default: return Maybe.Nothing();
  }
};

console.log(calculate('Add', 5, 3)); // Just(8)
console.log(calculate('Divide', 10, 0)); // Nothing
```

#### Scala Implementation

In Scala, we define a sealed trait `Operation` and implement the `calculate` function using pattern matching. We use `Option[Int]` to handle division by zero.

```scala
sealed trait Operation
case object Add extends Operation
case object Subtract extends Operation
case object Multiply extends Operation
case object Divide extends Operation

def calculate(operation: Operation, x: Int, y: Int): Option[Int] = operation match {
  case Add => Some(x + y)
  case Subtract => Some(x - y)
  case Multiply => Some(x * y)
  case Divide => if (y == 0) None else Some(x / y)
}

def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  println(calculate(Add, 5, 3))       // Some(8)
  println(calculate(Divide, 10, 0))   // None
}
```

### Visual Aids

To better understand the architecture of our calculator application and the flow of function calls, let's use a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Input] --> B[Determine Operation];
    B --> C{Operation Type};
    C -->|Add| D[Add Function];
    C -->|Subtract| E[Subtract Function];
    C -->|Multiply| F[Multiply Function];
    C -->|Divide| G[Divide Function];
    D --> H[Return Result];
    E --> H;
    F --> H;
    G --> H;
    H --> I[Output Result];
```

### Practical Exercises

To reinforce your understanding, try implementing the following exercises:

1. **Extend the Calculator:**
   - Add support for additional operations such as modulus and exponentiation.
   - Ensure that these operations are implemented as pure functions.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Improve the error handling mechanism to provide more informative error messages.
   - Consider using a custom error type to represent different error conditions.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Create a simple command-line interface for the calculator.
   - Allow users to input operations and numbers, and display the results.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have built a simple calculator using functional programming principles. By implementing basic arithmetic operations as pure functions and handling errors gracefully, we have created a robust and maintainable application. This project demonstrates the power of functional programming in designing clean and efficient software.

### What is a pure function?

- [x] A function where the output is determined only by its input values, without side effects.
