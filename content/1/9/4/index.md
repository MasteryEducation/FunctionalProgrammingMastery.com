## 9.4. Trees and Functional Data Structures

In functional programming, data structures play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. Among these structures, trees, particularly binary trees, stand out due to their versatility and efficiency in various applications such as searching, sorting, and representing hierarchical relationships. This section delves into the intricacies of binary trees, exploring their structure, uses, and how they can be navigated and manipulated using functional programming paradigms.

### Binary Trees and Their Uses

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. This simple yet powerful structure is foundational in computer science, underpinning many algorithms and systems.

#### Applications of Binary Trees

1. **Searching and Sorting:**
   - Binary Search Trees (BST) are a type of binary tree that maintains elements in a sorted order, allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
   
2. **Hierarchical Data Representation:**
   - Trees naturally represent hierarchical data, such as file systems, organizational structures, and decision processes.

3. **Expression Parsing:**
   - Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) are used in compilers to represent the syntax of programming languages.

4. **Networking and Routing:**
   - Trees are used in network routing algorithms to determine the most efficient paths.

### Navigating and Manipulating Trees Functionally

In functional programming, trees are typically manipulated using recursive techniques. This approach aligns with the immutable nature of functional programming, where data structures are not modified in place but rather transformed into new structures.

#### Recursive Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is a fundamental operation that involves visiting each node in a tree in a specific order. Common traversal methods include:

- **In-order Traversal:** Visits the left subtree, the root node, and then the right subtree.
- **Pre-order Traversal:** Visits the root node, the left subtree, and then the right subtree.
- **Post-order Traversal:** Visits the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the root node.

These traversal methods can be implemented recursively, leveraging the natural recursive structure of trees.

#### Example: In-order Traversal in Haskell

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

inOrder :: Tree a -> [a]
inOrder Empty = []
inOrder (Node x left right) = inOrder left ++ [x] ++ inOrder right
```

### Visual Aids

To better understand the structure of a binary tree and its traversal paths, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Root]
    A --> B[Left]
    A --> C[Right]
    B --> D[Left.Left]
    B --> E[Left.Right]
    C --> F[Right.Left]
    C --> G[Right.Right]
```

This diagram illustrates a simple binary tree with a root node and two levels of children, demonstrating the hierarchical nature of the structure.

### Code Snippets

Let's explore how binary trees can be implemented and manipulated in different functional programming languages.

#### Haskell Binary Tree Example

In Haskell, binary trees can be elegantly defined and manipulated using algebraic data types and pattern matching.

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

insert :: (Ord a) => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert x Empty = Node x Empty Empty
insert x (Node a left right)
  | x < a     = Node a (insert x left) right
  | otherwise = Node a left (insert x right)
```

In this example, the `insert` function recursively inserts a new element into the correct position in the tree, maintaining the binary search tree property.

#### Scala Binary Tree Example

Scala's case classes and pattern matching provide a concise way to define and work with binary trees.

```scala
sealed trait Tree[+A]
case object Empty extends Tree[Nothing]
case class Node[A](value: A, left: Tree[A], right: Tree[A]) extends Tree[A]

def insert[A : Ordering](x: A, tree: Tree[A]): Tree[A] = tree match {
  case Empty => Node(x, Empty, Empty)
  case Node(a, left, right) =>
    if (x < a) Node(a, insert(x, left), right)
    else Node(a, left, insert(x, right))
}
```

This Scala example mirrors the Haskell implementation, using pattern matching to recursively insert elements.

#### JavaScript (Using Immutable.js)

In JavaScript, libraries like Immutable.js facilitate the creation of immutable data structures, including trees.

```javascript
const { Record, Map } = require('immutable');

const Tree = Record({ value: null, left: null, right: null });

const insert = (x, tree) => {
  if (tree === null) return new Tree({ value: x, left: null, right: null });
  if (x < tree.value) {
    return tree.set('left', insert(x, tree.left));
  } else {
    return tree.set('right', insert(x, tree.right));
  }
};

let tree = null;
tree = insert(3, tree);
tree = insert(1, tree);
tree = insert(4, tree);
```

This JavaScript example demonstrates how to use Immutable.js to maintain immutability while manipulating a binary tree.
