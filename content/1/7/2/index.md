## 7.2. Building Pipelines with Function Composition

In the realm of functional programming, function composition is a powerful concept that allows developers to build complex operations by combining simpler functions. This approach not only enhances code clarity and maintainability but also promotes reusability and modularity. In this section, we will delve into the creation of data processing pipelines using function composition, explore its benefits, and provide practical examples in multiple functional programming languages.

### Creating Data Processing Pipelines

A data processing pipeline is a sequence of data transformations applied to a dataset. In functional programming, pipelines are constructed by composing functions, where the output of one function becomes the input to the next. This method is akin to an assembly line, where each stage performs a specific task, ultimately producing a refined output.

#### Example of a Data Processing Pipeline

Consider a scenario where we have a list of numbers, and we want to filter out the even numbers and then double each of them. This can be elegantly expressed using function composition:

- **Haskell:**

  ```haskell
  let process = map (*2) . filter even
  print (process [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) -- [4, 8]
  ```

- **JavaScript (using Ramda):**

  ```javascript
  const R = require('ramda');
  
  const process = R.pipe(
    R.filter(R.even),
    R.map(x => x * 2)
  );
  
  console.log(process([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // [4, 8]
  ```

- **Scala:**

  ```scala
  val process = (xs: List[Int]) => xs.filter(_ % 2 == 0).map(_ * 2)
  
  println(process(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))) // List(4, 8)
  ```

In these examples, the `process` function is a pipeline that first filters the list to retain only even numbers and then maps over the list to double each number. This approach is concise and expressive, making the code easy to read and understand.

### Enhancing Code Reusability and Modularity

Function composition naturally leads to more reusable and modular code. By breaking down complex operations into smaller, composable functions, each function can be reused in different contexts. This modularity allows developers to build flexible systems where components can be easily swapped or extended.

#### Benefits of Modularity

1. **Isolation of Concerns:** Each function in a pipeline performs a single task, making it easier to understand and test.
2. **Reusability:** Functions can be reused across different pipelines or projects, reducing redundancy.
3. **Maintainability:** Changes to one part of the pipeline do not affect others, simplifying maintenance and updates.

### Visual Aids

To better understand how function composition works in building pipelines, let's visualize the process using a flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input List] --> B[Filter Even Numbers];
    B --> C[Double Each Number];
    C --> D[Output List];
```

In this flowchart, the input list is processed through two stages: filtering even numbers and doubling each number. The composed functions represent these stages, transforming the data step by step.

### Practical Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of building pipelines with function composition, try the following exercises:

1. **Exercise 1:** Create a pipeline that takes a list of integers, filters out the odd numbers, and then squares each remaining number. Implement this in Haskell, JavaScript, and Scala.

2. **Exercise 2:** Modify the existing pipeline to include an additional step that sums up all the numbers after doubling them. Implement this change in your preferred language.

3. **Exercise 3:** Consider a real-world scenario where you need to process a list of user objects. Create a pipeline that extracts users over a certain age, sorts them by name, and then maps their names to uppercase.

### Conclusion

Building pipelines with function composition is a fundamental technique in functional programming that enhances code clarity, reusability, and modularity. By composing simple functions into complex operations, developers can create efficient and maintainable data processing systems. As you continue to explore functional programming, consider how function composition can be applied to solve real-world problems in a clean and elegant manner.
