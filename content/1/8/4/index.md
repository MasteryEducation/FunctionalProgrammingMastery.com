## 8.4. Practical Applications of Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming, offering elegant solutions to complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, self-referential components. In this section, we will explore how recursion can be applied to solve mathematical problems and implement efficient data processing algorithms. By understanding these applications, you will gain insight into the power and versatility of recursion in functional programming.

### Solving Mathematical Problems Recursively

Recursion is particularly well-suited for solving mathematical problems that can be defined in terms of smaller subproblems. Here are some classic examples:

#### Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer \\( n \\) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \\( n \\). It is denoted by \\( n! \\) and can be defined recursively as follows:

- Base case: \\( 0! = 1 \\)
- Recursive case: \\( n! = n \times (n-1)! \\)

Here's how you can implement the factorial function in Haskell:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

#### Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. It can be defined recursively as:

- Base cases: \\( F(0) = 0 \\), \\( F(1) = 1 \\)
- Recursive case: \\( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \\)

Here's a simple implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const fibonacci = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

console.log(fibonacci(5)); // Output: 5
```

#### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both without leaving a remainder. The Euclidean algorithm provides a recursive method to compute the GCD:

- Base case: \\( \text{gcd}(a, 0) = a \\)
- Recursive case: \\( \text{gcd}(a, b) = \text{gcd}(b, a \mod b) \\)

Here's how you can implement it in Scala:

```scala
def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
  if (b == 0) a else gcd(b, a % b)
}

println(gcd(48, 18)) // Output: 6
```

### Recursive Algorithms in Data Processing

Recursion is also a powerful tool for implementing algorithms that process data. Let's explore some common recursive algorithms used in data processing:

#### Quicksort

Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The process is then recursively applied to the sub-arrays.

Here's a Haskell implementation of quicksort:

```haskell
quicksort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) = quicksort [y | y <- xs, y < x]
                  ++ [x]
                  ++ quicksort [y | y <- xs, y >= x]
```

#### Mergesort

Mergesort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It is known for its stable sorting and \\( O(n \log n) \\) time complexity.

Here's a JavaScript implementation of mergesort:

```javascript
const merge = (left, right) => {
  let result = [];
  while (left.length && right.length) {
    if (left[0] < right[0]) {
      result.push(left.shift());
    } else {
      result.push(right.shift());
    }
  }
  return result.concat(left, right);
};

const mergesort = (arr) => {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = mergesort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergesort(arr.slice(mid));
  return merge(left, right);
};

console.log(mergesort([5, 3, 8, 4, 2])); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```

#### Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.

Here's a Scala implementation of binary search:

```scala
def binarySearch(arr: Array[Int], target: Int): Boolean = {
  def search(low: Int, high: Int): Boolean = {
    if (low > high) false
    else {
      val mid = low + (high - low) / 2
      if (arr(mid) == target) true
      else if (arr(mid) < target) search(mid + 1, high)
      else search(low, mid - 1)
    }
  }
  search(0, arr.length - 1)
}

println(binarySearch(Array(1, 3, 5, 7, 9), 5)) // true
println(binarySearch(Array(1, 3, 5, 7, 9), 4)) // false
```

### Visual Aids

To better understand how recursive algorithms work, let's visualize the quicksort algorithm using a flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is list empty?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Return empty list];
    B -- No --> D[Select pivot];
    D --> E[Partition list];
    E --> F[Recursively sort left sublist];
    F --> G[Recursively sort right sublist];
    G --> H[Concatenate sorted sublists and pivot];
    H --> I[Return sorted list];
```

This flowchart illustrates the recursive nature of quicksort, showing how the list is divided and conquered step by step.
