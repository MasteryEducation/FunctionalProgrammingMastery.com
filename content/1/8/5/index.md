## 8.5. Practical Exercises

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming, allowing functions to call themselves to solve problems. This section provides practical exercises to help you master recursion by implementing recursive functions, converting iterative processes, and visualizing recursion flows. These exercises will deepen your understanding of recursive logic and its applications in functional programming.

### Implementing Recursive Functions for Various Problems

Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Let's explore some classic problems that can be solved using recursion.

#### Exercise 1: Fibonacci Sequence (JavaScript)

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Your task is to implement a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

```javascript
// Task: Implement a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number
const fibonacci = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

console.log(fibonacci(5)); // 5
```

**Explanation:** This function calls itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case where `n` is 0 or 1.

#### Exercise 2: Factorial Calculation (Scala)

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Convert the following iterative factorial function into a recursive one.

```scala
// Task: Convert an iterative factorial function to a recursive one
def factorialIterative(n: Int): Int = {
  var result = 1
  for (i <- 2 to n) result *= i
  result
}

// Recursive version
def factorialRecursive(n: Int): Int = {
  if (n == 0) 1
  else n * factorialRecursive(n - 1)
}

println(factorialRecursive(5)) // 120
```

**Explanation:** The recursive function multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1` until it reaches the base case of `n` being 0.

#### Exercise 3: Tree Traversal (Haskell)

Tree structures are common in computer science. Implement a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree in Haskell.

```haskell
-- Define a binary tree data structure
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show)

-- Task: Implement in-order traversal
inOrderTraversal :: Tree a -> [a]
inOrderTraversal Empty = []
inOrderTraversal (Node value left right) =
  inOrderTraversal left ++ [value] ++ inOrderTraversal right

-- Example tree
let tree = Node 1 (Node 2 Empty Empty) (Node 3 Empty Empty)
print (inOrderTraversal tree) -- [2, 1, 3]
```

**Explanation:** The function recursively visits the left subtree, processes the current node, and then visits the right subtree.

### Converting Iterative Processes to Recursive Solutions

Understanding how to convert iterative processes into recursive solutions is crucial for mastering recursion. Let's practice this skill with a common problem.

#### Exercise 4: Sum of a List (JavaScript)

Convert the following iterative function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers into a recursive function.

```javascript
// Iterative version
function sumIterative(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

// Recursive version
function sumRecursive(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return 0;
  return arr[0] + sumRecursive(arr.slice(1));
}

console.log(sumRecursive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // 15
```

**Explanation:** The recursive function adds the first element of the array to the sum of the rest of the array until the array is empty.

### Visual Aids: Recursion Flow

Visualizing recursion can help you understand how recursive calls are made and resolved. Let's use Mermaid.js to illustrate the recursion flow of the Fibonacci sequence.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[fibonacci(5)] --> B[fibonacci(4)];
  A --> C[fibonacci(3)];
  B --> D[fibonacci(3)];
  B --> E[fibonacci(2)];
  C --> F[fibonacci(2)];
  C --> G[fibonacci(1)];
  D --> H[fibonacci(2)];
  D --> I[fibonacci(1)];
  E --> J[fibonacci(1)];
  E --> K[fibonacci(0)];
  F --> L[fibonacci(1)];
  F --> M[fibonacci(0)];
```

**Explanation:** This diagram shows the recursive calls made when calculating `fibonacci(5)`. Each node represents a function call, and the arrows indicate the flow of execution.

### What is the base case in a recursive function?

- [x] The condition under which the function stops calling itself
- [ ] The initial call to the recursive function
- [ ] The recursive call itself
- [ ] The return value of the recursive function

> **Explanation:** The base case is the condition that stops the recursion, preventing infinite loops.

### How does a recursive function typically solve a problem?

- [x] By breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems
- [ ] By iterating over a collection of elements
- [ ] By using global variables to store state
- [ ] By calling external libraries

> **Explanation:** Recursive functions solve problems by dividing them into smaller, manageable subproblems.

### What is the main advantage of using recursion over iteration?

- [x] It can simplify code for problems that have a natural recursive structure
- [ ] It always executes faster than iteration
- [ ] It uses less memory than iteration
- [ ] It is easier to debug than iteration

> **Explanation:** Recursion can simplify code for problems that are naturally recursive, such as tree traversals.

### In the Fibonacci sequence, what does the recursive function return when n is 0 or 1?

- [x] n
- [ ] 0
- [ ] 1
- [ ] n-1

> **Explanation:** The base case for the Fibonacci sequence returns `n` when `n` is 0 or 1.

### What is a common pitfall when using recursion?

- [x] Stack overflow due to deep recursion
- [ ] Lack of readability
- [ ] Inability to handle large datasets
- [ ] Difficulty in writing base cases

> **Explanation:** Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth exceeds the stack size.

### How can you optimize a recursive function to prevent stack overflow?

- [x] Use tail recursion
- [ ] Increase the stack size
- [ ] Use global variables
- [ ] Avoid using recursion

> **Explanation:** Tail recursion optimization can prevent stack overflow by reusing the current stack frame.

### What is the purpose of the `slice` method in the recursive sum function?

- [x] To create a new array without the first element
- [ ] To add elements to the array
- [ ] To sort the array
- [ ] To reverse the array

> **Explanation:** The `slice` method creates a new array without the first element, allowing the function to process the rest of the array.

### In the tree traversal exercise, what does the in-order traversal function return?

- [x] A list of node values in left-root-right order
- [ ] A list of node values in root-left-right order
- [ ] A list of node values in left-right-root order
- [ ] A list of node values in right-left-root order

> **Explanation:** In-order traversal returns node values in left-root-right order.

### What is the result of `factorialRecursive(5)` in the Scala exercise?

- [x] 120
- [ ] 24
- [ ] 60
- [ ] 720

> **Explanation:** The factorial of 5 is 120, calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

### True or False: Recursion is always more efficient than iteration.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> **Explanation:** Recursion is not always more efficient than iteration; it depends on the problem and implementation.
