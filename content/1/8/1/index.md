## 8.1. Recursive Thinking

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming that allows functions to call themselves to solve problems. This approach is particularly powerful for breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable subproblems. In this section, we will delve into the principles of recursive thinking, explore the structure of recursive functions, and provide practical examples in Haskell, JavaScript, and Scala.

### Understanding the Recursive Approach

At its core, recursion is a method where a function solves a problem by calling itself with simpler inputs until a base case is reached. This self-referential approach is akin to the divide-and-conquer strategy, where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, each of which is solved recursively.

#### Why Use Recursion?

Recursion is particularly useful in scenarios where a problem can naturally be divided into similar subproblems, such as:

- Calculating factorials
- Traversing data structures like trees and graphs
- Implementing algorithms like quicksort and mergesort

By using recursion, we can write elegant and concise solutions that are often more intuitive than their iterative counterparts.

### Base Cases and Recursive Cases

A recursive function typically consists of two main components: base cases and recursive cases.

#### Base Cases

The base case is a condition that stops the recursion. It is essential to define clear base cases to prevent infinite recursion, which can lead to stack overflow errors. The base case represents the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion.

#### Recursive Cases

The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a modified input, gradually reducing the problem size. Each recursive call should bring the input closer to the base case, ensuring that the recursion eventually terminates.

### Visualizing Recursive Function Calls

To better understand the flow of recursive function calls, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js diagram. Consider the recursive calculation of a factorial:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start: factorial(n)] --> B{n == 0?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Return 1];
    B -- No --> D[Calculate n * factorial(n-1)];
    D --> A;
```

In this diagram, the function `factorial(n)` checks if `n` is zero. If true, it returns 1 (base case). Otherwise, it calculates `n * factorial(n-1)` (recursive case) and continues the process until the base case is reached.

### Code Snippets

Let's explore how recursion is implemented in different functional programming languages through the example of calculating a factorial.

#### Haskell

Haskell's concise syntax makes it ideal for expressing recursive functions:

```haskell
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

In this Haskell example, the base case is `factorial 0 = 1`, and the recursive case is `factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)`.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript, while not purely functional, supports recursion through its function expressions:

```javascript
const factorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
};
```

Here, the base case is `if (n === 0) return 1;`, and the recursive case is `return n * factorial(n - 1);`.

#### Scala

Scala, a hybrid functional language, also provides a straightforward way to implement recursion:

```scala
def factorial(n: Int): Int = {
  if (n == 0) 1
  else n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

In Scala, the base case is `if (n == 0) 1`, and the recursive case is `else n * factorial(n - 1)`.

### Practical Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of recursion, try implementing the following exercises:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
2. **Sum of Array:** Implement a recursive function to find the sum of elements in an array.
3. **String Reversal:** Create a recursive function to reverse a string.

### What is recursion in programming?

- [x] A method where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
- [ ] A technique for iterating over arrays.
- [ ] A way to handle exceptions in code.

- [x] `n * factorial(n - 1)`
