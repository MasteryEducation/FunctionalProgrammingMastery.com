## 10.5. Practical Exercises

In this section, we delve into practical exercises designed to solidify your understanding of error handling in functional programming using algebraic data types. By engaging with these exercises, you'll learn how to implement error handling patterns using `Option/Maybe` and `Either` types, transforming traditional exception-based error handling into a more functional approach. These exercises will be demonstrated across multiple functional programming languages, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these concepts are applied in different contexts.

### Implementing Error Handling with Algebraic Data Types

Algebraic data types like `Option/Maybe` and `Either` provide a robust framework for handling errors in a functional programming paradigm. They allow us to represent the presence or absence of a value (`Option/Maybe`) or the possibility of two outcomes (`Either`), thus avoiding the pitfalls of exceptions.

#### Exercise 1: Refactoring with Either in JavaScript

In this exercise, you'll refactor a function that currently uses exceptions for error handling into one that uses the `Either` type. This transformation will help you understand how to handle errors functionally in JavaScript.

**Original Function Using Exceptions:**

```javascript
const divide = (x, y) => {
  if (y === 0) throw new Error("Division by zero");
  return x / y;
};
```

**Refactored Function Using Either:**

```javascript
// Assuming a simple Either implementation
const Either = {
  Left: (value) => ({ isLeft: true, value }),
  Right: (value) => ({ isRight: true, value }),
};

const safeDivide = (x, y) => {
  if (y === 0) return Either.Left("Division by zero error");
  return Either.Right(x / y);
};

// Usage example
const result = safeDivide(10, 0);
if (result.isLeft) {
  console.error(result.value); // Output: Division by zero error
} else {
  console.log(result.value);
}
```

#### Exercise 2: Refactoring with Either in Scala

Scala's `Either` type is a powerful tool for error handling. In this exercise, you'll refactor a Scala function to use `Either` instead of exceptions.

**Original Function Using Exceptions:**

```scala
def divide(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  if (y == 0) throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero")
  x / y
}
```

**Refactored Function Using Either:**

```scala
def safeDivide(x: Int, y: Int): Either[String, Int] = {
  if (y == 0) Left("Division by zero error")
  else Right(x / y)
}

// Usage example
val result = safeDivide(10, 0)
result match {
  case Left(error) => println(s"Error: $error") // Output: Error: Division by zero error
  case Right(value) => println(s"Result: $value")
}
```

### Refactoring Code to Use Functional Error Handling Patterns

Refactoring existing code to use functional error handling patterns can significantly improve code readability and reliability. By replacing exceptions with algebraic data types, you can make your code more predictable and easier to maintain.

#### Exercise 3: Refactoring with Option/Maybe in Haskell

Haskell's `Maybe` type is an excellent way to handle optional values without resorting to exceptions. In this exercise, you'll refactor a Haskell function to use `Maybe`.

**Original Function Using Exceptions:**

```haskell
divide :: Double -> Double -> Double
divide _ 0 = error "Division by zero"
divide x y = x / y
```

**Refactored Function Using Maybe:**

```haskell
divideSafe :: Double -> Double -> Maybe Double
divideSafe _ 0 = Nothing
divideSafe x y = Just (x / y)

-- Usage example
case divideSafe 10 0 of
  Nothing -> putStrLn "Error: Division by zero"
  Just result -> print result
```

### Visual Aids

To better understand the transformation from exception-based to type-based error handling, consider the following diagram illustrating the process:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Exception-Based Error Handling] -->|Refactor| B[Type-Based Error Handling];
    B --> C[Option/Maybe];
    B --> D[Either];
    C --> E[Handle Absence of Value];
    D --> F[Handle Two Possible Outcomes];
```

### Practical Exercises

#### Exercise 4: Implementing Error Handling in F#

F# provides robust support for functional programming, including error handling with `Option` and `Result` types. In this exercise, you'll implement a function using these types.

**Task:** Implement a function that safely divides two numbers using F#'s `Result` type.

```fsharp
let safeDivide x y =
    if y = 0 then Error "Division by zero error"
    else Ok (x / y)

// Usage example
match safeDivide 10 0 with
| Error msg -> printfn "Error: %s" msg
| Ok result -> printfn "Result: %d" result
```

#### Exercise 5: Transforming JavaScript Code with Functional Patterns

Refactor a JavaScript function that handles errors using traditional try-catch blocks to use functional patterns with `Option`.

**Original Function Using Try-Catch:**

```javascript
function parseNumber(str) {
  try {
    const num = parseInt(str, 10);
    if (isNaN(num)) throw new Error("Invalid number");
    return num;
  } catch (e) {
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Refactored Function Using Option:**

```javascript
const Option = {
  Some: (value) => ({ isSome: true, value }),
  None: () => ({ isNone: true }),
};

const parseNumberSafe = (str) => {
  const num = parseInt(str, 10);
  return isNaN(num) ? Option.None() : Option.Some(num);
};

// Usage example
const result = parseNumberSafe("abc");
if (result.isNone) {
  console.log("Error: Invalid number");
} else {
  console.log("Parsed number:", result.value);
}
```

### What is the primary advantage of using algebraic data types for error handling in functional programming?

- [x] They provide a type-safe way to handle errors without exceptions.
- [ ] They make the code run faster.
- [ ] They allow for more complex error messages.
- [ ] They reduce the need for documentation.

> **Explanation:** Algebraic data types like `Option/Maybe` and `Either` provide a type-safe way to handle errors, making the code more predictable and reducing runtime exceptions.

### How does the `Either` type differ from the `Option/Maybe` type?

- [x] `Either` can represent two possible outcomes, while `Option/Maybe` represents the presence or absence of a value.
- [ ] `Either` is used for numeric operations, while `Option/Maybe` is used for strings.
- [ ] `Either` is only available in Scala, while `Option/Maybe` is available in all languages.
- [ ] `Either` is more efficient than `Option/Maybe`.
